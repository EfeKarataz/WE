# Work distribution

Our method of communication during this project consisted of seminars (werkcolleges), meetings, and additional consultation over text. In our first meeting, each team member presented a dataset along with at least two different perspectives. We then chose the subject and data that best suited the requirements for the project. Our first step after determining the subject was to clean and merge the datasets from each year to form one singular dataset, for more information go to [data and preprocessing](/docs/dataset-preprocessing.md). We also started to discuss possible graphs that could be made to support the different perspectives. We then started making the graphs and at the same time, we started to work on a story that could build a narrative around the graphs. After the cleaning and merging process was complete we further improved the graphs as well as the story. Then, with the help of the given peer feedback, we created the final draft.

He participated in the making of the graphs and their associated captions. He was also responsible for taking notes during meetings and made a clear overview of everyone's responsibilities. The intro was also written by Kim.

Peter first worked on cleaning the survey years 2017-2022. He then participated in making the graphs. Later on in the project, he helped improve the storyline together with Wim. Peter also presented the project for peer feedback.

**Wim**

Wim participated in improving the graphs. He was also responsible for creating the basis of the storyline and also helped improve the storyline during the project.
